# Category theory

This is a paragraph example talking about something. Good to **stress** something, or _gently highlight_ things to bring the reader's focus. Link to [external resources](https://github.com) is also useful.

<Translation defaultValue="en" />

> Generally, MDX highlighting inherits from the Markdown.
